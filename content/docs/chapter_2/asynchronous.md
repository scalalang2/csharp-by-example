## Asynchronous

Asynchronous programming allows you to run multiple tasks concurrently, without blocking the main thread of your application. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to complete, such as I/O operations, CPU-bound operations, or any other blocking operations.

C# provides the async keyword to make your code asynchronous.
