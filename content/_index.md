## C# by Example
[C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) is a very powerful object-oriented programming language that can be used in a variety of fields, from simple command-line commands to game servers, web servers, distributed systems and so on.

This is not a complete guide, but rather a collection of examples that will help you to understand the basics of the language and to start writing your own programs.

I'm inspired by the [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/).
